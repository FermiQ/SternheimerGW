!> Wrapper routine for PWâ€™s gk_sort routine
!!
!! gk_sort of PW works well as long as the k-point mesh is consistent
!! throughout the calculation. However, for the k points not in the original
!! mesh of the ground-state calculation \f$|k + G| < E_{\text{cut}}\f$
!! might be fulfilled for more G vectors than for any k-points in the original
!! mesh. In this case, the original gk_sort would crash, because the allocated
!! array is to small. Solution: temporarily increase the array boundary for
!! gk_sort and decrease it afterwards.
