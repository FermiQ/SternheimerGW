!> This module keeps track of the SGW version number.
!!
!! We use semantic versioning as much as is reasonably possible for a code
!! relying on the occationally rapid changes in the Quantum Espresso package.
!! A detailed description can be found here http://semver.org/ .
!! We do not use the patch sublevel of the version number. These commits
!! are identified by the git hash tag.
!!
!! Here is an outline of the general principles:
!! - Whenever there is an incompatible change to the API, update the major
!!   version number. In practice this means that if you make significant
!!   changes to the interface of a subroutine or the input file.
!!   Significant are all those changes that would break an old file unless
!!   it is modified to the new behavior.
!! - Whenever a new feature is introduced and whenever QE is updated, update
!!   the minor revision number. Every time you do a minor release update the 
!!   compatible_QE_revision field to the correct revision, so that one knows
!!   with which revision of QE the code should compile.
!! 
!! Use tags to identify releases and add the compatible QE release. Example:
!! If version 1.15 of SGW is released with QE version 6.2 use the tag
!! v1.15_QE_v6.2. Do only use this form of the tag if the version corresponds
!! excactly to the unmodified version of QE; otherwise use simply the
!! v1.15 tag.
!!
!! For versions between commits the git-describe functionality is used to
!! determine the version number.
