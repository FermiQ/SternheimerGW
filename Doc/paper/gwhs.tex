\begin{abstract}
We propose a new approach to quasiparticle GW calculations based on the
direct evaluation of the Green's function and of the screened Coulomb interaction.
The Green's function is computed by using Haydock's recursion method,
and the screened Coulomb interaction is computed using density-functional
perturbation theory. The frequency dependence is explicitely calculated,
without resorting to the plasmon pole approximation. We implemented the
proposed method within the empirical pseudopotential formalism and 
studied silicon as a test case. We discuss the advantages of our method
over existing approaches and future plans.
