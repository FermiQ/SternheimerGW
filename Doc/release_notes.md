Release notes
=============

Version 0.7
-----------

Added new routine to reorder arrays according to an igk array.
Added automatic documentation options (Doxygen/Ford).
Added some checks if the solver converged.
Cleanup some unused files and variables within files.


Version 0.6
-----------

This is the initial version from which we started documenting the changes.
From now on, we plan to document all changes in the form of release notes.
The plan is commit new versions frequently, so that the changes between
versions are small and easy to document.
