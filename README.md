Sternheimer GW
==============
The SGW code evaluates the quasi-particle correction to the DFT results 
in the GW approximation. The Greens function G and the screened Coulomb W
interaction are evaluated solving Sternheimer equations (linear response
problem) instead of summing over the virtual, unoccupied subspace.

The main target of SGW are very accurate calculations for crystals and
surfaces. We can evaluate the full band structure along any user selected
k-point path. In addition to the quasi-particle corrections to the
eigenvalues, we provide the full frequency dependent spectral function,
which can be compared to experimental ARPES spectroscopy.
