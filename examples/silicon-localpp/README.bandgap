 If I use any other possibility for cutoffs and pseudization
 I obtain a null gap or even a semimetal ( Eg = -0.1 eV).
 It seems that the only way to obtain a decent gap is to
 enforce a pseudopotential which is essentially the Si+4
 potential beyond 1 au.
 
 This should be reasonable as long as the 1s and 2s,2p core states
 are localized within 1 au.
