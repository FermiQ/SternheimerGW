# I modified ncpp.f in fhi98PP/src in order to generate the p pseudo wf
# using the s pseudo - and then unscreen the pseudo using this pseudocharge
#
# when fhi2upf is used, there is an +Infinity in the KB projector coefficient,
# this is spurious (we do not use projectors) and needs to be set to zero
#
# (pw.x does not like it when we have no projectors - in this way we put in a
# fake projector with a vanishing contirbution)
