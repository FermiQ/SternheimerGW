Calculation of W(\r,\r';\omega=0), \mu, \mu* for MgB2.
This is a (relatively) quick calculation. The ground
state is calculated on a 10x10x10 grid. W_{\q} is then 
calculated for 84 q-points.

mpirun -np 8 ~/PW/pw.x -npool 8 < mgb2.scf.in > mgb2.scf.out
mpirun -np x  ~/SGW/gw.x -nimage n -nimage m < mgb2.coul.in > mgb2.coul.out


Once W has been calculated mv./tmp/_gw0/mgb2.coul1 to ./tmp/mgb2.coul1
(i.e. up one directory). Then you can run the post-processing code
to perform the Fermi surface matrix element:

mpirun -np x  ~/SGW/sgwpp/coulmat.x -nimage n < mgb2.sgwpp.in > mgb2.sgwpp.out

Note the post processing code only accepts image level parallelism (do not pool).
