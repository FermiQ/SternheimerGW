 This calculation has been done using vxc taken from an espresso-pseudopotential
 calculation (at the ridiculous cutoff of 5Ry - which actually is not too bad
 when comparing to vxc at 20Ry).

 The reason is that within EPM I cannot define properly a vxc (well I coul but
 the density is not necessarily self-consistent with the empirical potential).
